# Colorcode
Inspired by [this post](https://medium.com/programming-ideas-tutorial-and-experience/3a6db2743a1e), this plugin aims to do exactly this. It reads the tags file in your working directory and adds a match for each tag.

## Installation

* Using [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen), run the following commands:

        % cd ~/.vim/bundle
        % git clone https://github.com/ferranpm/vim-colorcode

## Usage

This plugin will only work if the tags file is in your working directory.
